## Abstract
With the increasing volume of macromolecular density map data, the application of cryo-EM in structural biology research is becoming increasingly widespread. However, corresponding fitting techniques are now facing higher demands in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In this study, we propose an innovative fitting method that first preprocesses density maps using deep learning, followed by a global-local optimization strategy to accurately fit protein structures into cryo-EM density maps. This method was comprehensively tested on both ET and EM datasets, with results showing that the DEMO-EMfit model achieved an average TM-score of 0.79 and an RMSD of 18.03 Ã…, demonstrating higher precision and stability. Further detailed analysis indicates that this approach significantly enhances the accuracy of cryo-EM density map fitting and effectively reduces structural errors.
